## About Me

### English
I am Victor Casagrande, I hold a degree in Computer Science from UNESC, and I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Fullstack Development of Modern Cloud Systems (Cloud Native) at UNESC.

During my three years at Torrecid in Brazil, I worked in a dynamic and challenging environment where I communicated daily in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. This allowed me to expand my knowledge in various areas of computing. I worked in the DevOps field, optimizing processes and ensuring the efficiency of network infrastructure and physical servers in all branches across the Americas. Additionally, I was responsible for providing technical support to users, resolving complex issues related to hardware and software.

At Torrecid, I also advanced in software development, leading projects from conception to implementation, creating customized solutions to meet the specific needs of the company. I actively contributed to the implementation of new features and improvements in existing systems, standing out for my ability to find innovative and efficient solutions using technologies such as Visual Basic .Net, Visual Basic 6, Crystal Reports, PL/SQL (Oracle), C#, and GIT.

Furthermore, I had an enriching experience at Angeloni, where I gained significant knowledge in Progress and program documentation, which further enhanced my ability to develop robust and well-documented solutions.
